Its distinct and slightly spicy aroma makes it a useful representative of root vegetables within the cruciferous family for classification and sensor calibration tasks.",
    "walnuts": "Walnuts are the edible seeds of the Juglans regia tree, valued for their rich, slightly bitter flavor and distinctive aroma. Their scent profile is earthy, nutty, and mildly astringent, with key volatile compounds including hexanal, pentanal, and 1-octen-3-ol, which contribute green, fatty, and mushroom-like notes. Juglone, a phenolic compound unique to walnuts, adds a woody, slightly sharp undertone. When roasted, additional Maillard reaction products such as pyrazines and furans enhance the aroma with warm, toasted nuances. In gas sensor analysis, walnuts produce moderate signal intensities with a relatively stable temporal profile, reflecting their balanced composition of lipids and volatiles. Their complex, earthy scent helps differentiate them from sweeter or more buttery nuts in classification tasks."
